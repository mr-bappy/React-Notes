# Is React.js library or framework?

- we can call it as React.js or ReactJS or React.
- only knows one thing: creating awesome UIs and SPAs.
- it is all about components.
- try to avoid duplicate code, follows DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).

# How React works?
### Component ---> Instances ---> (React Elements --> reconcilation) ---> DOM Element ---> Final UI
### Compiler - Babble

# Why React.js over Vanilla JS?
- before, we have to create seperate files for HTML, CSS and JS
- in React, we create a component(basically a seperate directory) where it combines HTML, CSS and JS, we can use that component at multiple sections instead of rewriting the whole code. 
- this makes seperation of concerns easier

# Why React.js?
- declarative, focuses on displaying UI rather than how to achieve it.
- makes code easier to read and maintain, focused more on end result rather than steps involved to achieve.
- most popular JS library for building UIs
- Component-Based Architecture
- Rich Ecosystem - npm packages
- Strong Community Support - Online / GitHub
