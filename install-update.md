### Ways to create react project
- Custom (not recommended)
- create-react-app (not recommended)
- vite (recommended)
    - there are several ways to create with vite using npm, yarn, pnpm or bun, but we have provided to create with npm, you can read documentation or watch YouTube videos about other ways.
    - to install with vite, you can use command: npm create vite@latest
    - change directory i.e move to created project by using command: cd your-project-name 
    - then install necessary packages by using command: npm install or npm i
    - to run project: npm run dev

- tip: if you have already created a folder and given a name, but when using that 'npm create vite@latest' command, it is asking to give a name to your project and it creates another folder, to avoid that, use './' at last of the command, e.g: npm create vite@latest ./, this will create your project without asking name to give.
